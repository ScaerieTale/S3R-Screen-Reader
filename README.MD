# IF YOU'RE READING THIS
... Sorry about that.  This is supposed to be a private unstable/for-testing only branch, and you reading this means I probably goofed and accidentally pushed it to the repo.

Don't worry, there's nothing dangerous here!  It's just probably unstable or might not work like the public facing S3r TTS app :)

Well, it's either that, or, I accidentally included this readme when I merged the finished testing in with the main branch which is entirely possible, too.
