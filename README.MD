# Super Simple Screen Reader OFFLINE CODE

Update: Offline Mode is now available as a (very) early alpha build for Windows users.  A new version using the new UX is coming soon™!

## NEW FEATURES
Besides a much better looking,more responsive UI, I've also implemented voice selection, pitch, and rate sliders!

Just like the name implies, this is a super simple screen reader.  It (currently) takes any text that you paste into it, selects whatever your browser default Text to Speech voice is, and speaks it to you.  First priority is getting this set up as an offline only option for extremely privacy-minded folks.  See To Do below for more.

## KNOWN BUG(S)
If you're on Windows, currently Microsoft David is the default voice, even if you have it set to a different one as your default.  This is a Windows bug that's existed for as long as I can remember, so it's unfortunately above my pay grade.

## TO DO
I plan on adding the following features soon™, but wanted to get the absolute basic website and offline electron app up ASAP.

* Different voices
* Pause and Resume
* Light/Dark Modes

## FAQ
Q: Is my text sent to a server somewhere?
A: NO.  This script runs client side only.  There's now an offline version, or you can download the code and run it as an offline website for complete security. :)

Q: Is this open source?
A: YES.  It's a simple javascript function that calls an existing API available in most, if not all modern browsers.  I've got no reason to keep it to myself <3  If you want to use this code, please feel free.  I'll be happy you found it useful! ☺

Q: Do you accept code contribution?
A: No, sorry!  This is a side/pet project of mine, but if you want to fork it and add to it, please feel free!

I don't have a sponsorship thing set up (yet) as I'm focusing on just getting this thing working.  And support is absolutely NOT required, but if you find my stuff useful I have a ko-fi at https://www.ko-fi.com/ScaerieTale and a *very old* PayPal URL, https://paypal.me/CrystalMystical that links to my ScaerietaleProductions PayPal account.
